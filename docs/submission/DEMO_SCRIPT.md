### **0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook & Problem (Landing Page)**
*   **Visual:** Start on the Landing Page (`http://localhost:8000/`). Scroll slowly.
*   **Voiceover:** "Hi, this is [Team Name]. We built **TrendOps**, an autonomous AI control plane that decodes the YouTube attention economy."
*   **Action:** Point cursor to "Turn YouTube Trends Into Strategic Intelligence."
*   **Voiceover:** "Manual trend analysis is slow and biased. We built a multi-agent swarm that ingests live data, mathematically clusters disparate videos, and uses LLMs to generate investor-grade strategy in seconds."

### **0:30 - 1:15 | The "Magic" (Dashboard & Orchestration)**
*   **Action:** Click "Try It Live".
*   **Visual:** Dashboard loads.
*   **Voiceover:** "Welcome to the Command Center. Let's analyze a live market."
*   **Action:** Click the **🇮🇳 India – Music** quick-launch button.
*   **Voiceover:** "I'm deploying the swarm to analyze India's music scene."
*   **Action:** Click "INITIALIZE SEQUENCE".
*   **Visual:** Watch the progress bar and the **AI Orchestration Engine** checkmarks on the right.
*   **Voiceover:** "Watch the right panel. This isn't a black box. You see the **Governance Agent** validating inputs, the **Data Agent** fetching live API data, and the **Analytics Agent** clustering themes in real-time."

### **1:15 - 2:00 | The Insight (Results)**
*   **Visual:** Results fade in.
*   **Action:** Hover over the "Trend Intensity" score.
*   **Voiceover:** "The system doesn't just summarize; it scores. Here, we see a Trend Intensity of [X], driven by [mention top theme from chart]."
*   **Action:** Scroll to **Emerging Patterns**.
*   **Voiceover:** "Instead of generic stats, the Intelligence Agent identifies specific patterns—like the rise of hyper-local Haryanvi music over massive Bollywood tracks."

### **2:00 - 2:40 | The Value (Strategic Implications)**
*   **Action:** Scroll to **Startup Opportunities**.
*   **Voiceover:** "This is the killer feature. The AI proposes actual business models—like a 'Vocal-Local Talent Agency'—based on the engagement gaps it found."
*   **Action:** Scroll to **Why This Matters Right Now**.
*   **Voiceover:** "It creates urgency for decision-makers."

### 2:40 - 3:00 | The Architecture (Archestra Alignment)
*   **Visual:** Briefly show the **Architecture Diagram** in README or the `Dockerfile`.
*   **Voiceover:** "TrendOps isn't just a prototype; it's an **Archestra-ready reference implementation**. We built it with a stateless, containerized runtime that mirrors the platform's core pillars:
    1.  **Strict Governance** on every input.
    2.  **Centralized Observable Logging** for audit trails.
    3.  **Horizontal Scalability** via Docker."
*   **Voiceover:** "This is a secure, enterprise-grade agent swarm ready for production deployment. Thanks for watching."
